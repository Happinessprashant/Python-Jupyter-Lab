    "# # File handling in Python refers to the process of working with files,\n",
    "# # including reading from and writing to files. Python provides built-in \n",
    "# # functions and methods to perform various file operations. \n",
    "# # Here's an overview of the basic file handling operations in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Opening a File:\n",
    "# #          To open a file, you can use the built-in open() function, which takes the \n",
    "# #         file path and the mode as parameters. The mode can be 'r' for reading, \n",
    "# #         'w' for writing (creating a new file or overwriting an existing file), \n",
    "# #         'a' for appending (adding data to the end of an existing file), or \n",
    "# #         'x' for exclusive creation (creating a new file but raising an error\n",
    "#              if it already exists).\n",
    "\n",
    "# # python\n",
    "# # Copy code\n",
    "# file = open(\"filename.txt\", \"r\")  # Open file for reading\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reading from a File:\n",
    "#             Once a file is opened for reading, you can use\n",
    "#         various methods to read its contents. The most common methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# read(): Reads the entire content of the file as a string.\n",
    "# readline(): Reads a single line from the file.\n",
    "# readlines(): Reads all lines of the file and returns them as a list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "# python\n",
    "# Copy code\n",
    "# content = file.read()  # Read the entire file content\n",
    "# line = file.readline()  # Read a single line\n",
    "# lines = file.readlines()  # Read all lines\n",
    "# Writing to a File:\n",
    "# To write data to a file, you need to open it in write mode or append mode. You can use the following methods to write data:\n",
    "\n",
    "# write(): Writes a string to the file.\n",
    "# writelines(): Writes a list of strings to the file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "# python\n",
    "# Copy code\n",
    "# file = open(\"filename.txt\", \"w\")  # Open file for writing\n",
    "# file.write(\"Hello, World!\")  # Write a string to the file\n",
    "# file.close()  # Close the file\n",
    "# Closing a File:\n",
    "# It's important to close the file after you finish working with it. You can do this by calling the close() method on the file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# python\n",
    "# Copy code\n",
    "# file.close()  # Close the file\n",
    "# Alternatively, you can use the with statement, which automatically takes care of closing the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "# python\n",
    "# Copy code\n",
    "# with open(\"filename.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "#     # Perform operations on the file\n",
    "#     # The file will be automatically closed after this block\n",
    "# These are the basic file handling operations in Python. \n",
    "#    It's important to handle exceptions and errors that may occur during file operations,\n",
    "#     and ensure proper file closure to avoid resource leaks."
